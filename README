This extension is made so that you can make transformations on your current URL
using a regular expression. It was designed with internal corporate networks in
mind, so it's of limited usage for the general Firefox user.

In order to use it, pull the source and modify chrome/content/transforms.xml.
It looks like this at the moment:

<transforms>
  <transform label="Bobbo's Dev"
             from="'[\\w-]+\\.example\\.[\\w-]+(:[0-9]+)?'"
             dest="'bobbo.example.local:3000'" />
  <transform label="Bubba's Production"
             from="'[\\w-]+\\.example\\.[\\w-]+(:[0-9]+)?'"
             dest="'bubba.example.com'" />
</transforms>

The imagined situation is a developer named Bobbo who has set up the corporate
network to throw people who go to bobbo.example.local at his own server. Since
it's running Rails in development, it's on port 3000. At the same time, the
production environment is running on Bubba's subdomain, on port 80. Now say
a bug has been spotted in production at the URL:

http://bubba.example.com/catalog/page/3?view=thumbnails&filter=sunsets

In order to view this same page in his development environment, Bobbo would be
required to change two parts of the hostname and add a port number. Not that
difficult, but let's throw into the mix a dozen developers who have decided to
run their servers on random port numbers. Add to that several different
staging environments and you have a mild headache.

TransformURL is a simple tool to remove this pain. It should be reasonably
obvious how to configure the XML file. Once you've done this, you will need to
ZIP the directory (using the Send to Compressed Folder utility works fine) and
rename it to an XPI file, and then serve that. Details of how to do this are
found here:

A way to modify your settings without rebuilding the XPI every time. =P
